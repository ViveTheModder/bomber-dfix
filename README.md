# bomber-dfix
A patcher for [Deelseton](https://www.youtube.com/@Deelseton)'s [DBZ BT2 DX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95p83apY2LI), currently on v1.04.

Similar to [the one I wrote for DBZ Sparking! HYPER](https://github.com/ViveTheModder/dbzs-hyper-patcher), though without command-line support and instead with more silliness (hence why it looks so unprofessional).

# Demonstration
Upon execution, the user needs to **click on** the *Deelmoji* (yes, that is what I am calling it) **for a file chooser to show up**.

If an **outdated version** of the ISO (or an **entirely invalid** ISO) is provided, the tool **will not accept it**.

As a result, the Deelmoji will get very angry. Although, he can still be **clicked on** (think of it as a second chance - essentially **another file chooser**).

Otherwise, if the latest DBZ BT2 DX ISO is provided, the Deelmoji will be rather pleased, kindly asking if the user wants **a backup prior to any patches being applied**.

If either ``Yes`` or ``No`` is clicked, another (less silly-looking) window will show up. More patches are to be expected for later versions of Bomber D'fiX, if any will be made.

For clarification, each patch **comes with a name and a tooltip (description)**.

The tool will **only apply changes from patches checked** by the user. Future patches may take longer, especially if several are applied, hence why the time required is shown on the message box.
